### Readme de hello-git

This was part of a practice to see how GitHub worked back when I also learned a bit about Git. As I didn't need to use it before the repository is 'a bit' abonadoned, but as I'm planing to use GitHub way more now, things might get a change.
More to come soon, if classes leave me enough time.
